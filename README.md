Time table management 
The timetable is the basic thing that influences academics in an institution. It is not easy to create; it
 takes more time, effort, and hard work. Most importantly, there are criteria for allocating a particular
 period to a particular faculty in institutions. This criteria sometimes includes the number of periods in
 a week, lab periods, details of faculty, students, and subjects and depending upon these inputs, it will
 generate a possible timetable, making optimal utilization of all resources in a way that will best suit the
 specified constraints or college rules. An automatic timetable generator system is an automated system
 that generates a timetable according to the data given by the user. The main requirement of the
 application is to provide details about the branch, semester, subjects, labs, and total number of
 periods. A list of subjects may include electives as well as core subjects.
